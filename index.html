        <h1>Introduction to Music Production</h1>
        <p>Music production is an intricate process that involves various stages, from composing to recording, mixing, and mastering. It combines creativity with technology to produce music that resonates with listeners.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Composing</h2>
            <p>This is the initial stage where melodies, harmonies, and rhythms are created. Composers may use instruments, digital audio workstations (DAWs), and various software to write their music.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Recording</h2>
            <p>Recording involves capturing the composed music. This can be done in professional studios or home setups, using microphones, instruments, and recording software.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mixing</h2>
            <p>Mixing is the process of blending all recorded tracks to create a cohesive piece. This involves adjusting levels, panning, and adding effects like reverb and compression.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mastering</h2>
            <p>Mastering is the final step, where the mixed track is polished to ensure it sounds good on all playback systems. It involves fine-tuning frequencies, volume levels, and overall sound quality.</p>
